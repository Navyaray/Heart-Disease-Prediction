# Heart-Disease-Prediction
## Detection of Heart Disease using Machine Learning with Logistic Regression, Supoort Vector Machine, Decission Tree, AdaBoost, KNN & RF.
Heart disease is the most significant cause of mortality worldwide, and early identification is crucial in preventing its progression. Machine learning (ML) is useful in supporting decision-making and risk assessment from the huge amount of data produced by the healthcare industry on cardiac disorders due to its supremacy in pattern identification and categorization. This research paper examines the identification of heart disease using machine learning techniques and Python programming. The dataset I have used is from an ongoing cardiovascular study on residents of the town of Framingham, Massachusetts. The classification goal is to predict whether the patient has a 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD). The patientsâ€™ information is provided by the dataset which includes over 4,000 records and 15 attributes where each attribute is a potential risk factor. This paper aims to propose an improved machine learning algorithm with better accuracy to predict whether a person has a 10-year risk of coronary heart disease. Also, this prediction system enhances medical care and reduces costs. This project provides us with valuable information that will aid in predicting heart disease patients.
